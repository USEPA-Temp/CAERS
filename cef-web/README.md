# CefWeb

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8. The generated code lives in `src/main/webapp`


## Development server

Run `mvn spring-boot:run` Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/cef-web`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

You need to open a command line and navigate to your project and to `src/main/webapp` and run `ng build --watch` to continuously build the Angular TypeScript code while developing and reloading it.


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `target/www/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
This is automatically done by Maven frontend plugin in the pom.xml.


## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
